## Czech Python User Group

At the end of 2015, two new websites about the Czech Python community emerged.
The [python.cz](http://python.cz/) is the main gateway for all sorts
of information, while at [pyvo.cz](http://pyvo.cz) it's all about our meetups.
You're always welcome to come, or present at them!

## PyCon SK

Enjoyed attending our very first PyCon? We can't provide our "first" anymore, but
what about visiting the one organized in March by our friends in Slovakia? Check
out [PyCon SK](https://pycon.sk/sk/) and their
[Django Girls event](http://djangogirls.org/bratislava/). They are still looking
for speakers, coaches and of course, attendees.

## Thank you!

We hope you enjoyed the end of 2015. We're looking forward to the new challenges
2016 brings us and we hope you stay with us, as awesome and as supporting as you
always were.

PyCon CZ Team
