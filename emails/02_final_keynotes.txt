Keynotes

Yesterday we received valuable feedback from you and updated our website
accordingly. Tons of new information were added, other information were
clarified. Thank you all for your patience!

The most important news: Our second keynote speaker, Amber Brown, is confirmed.
She is the core developer and release manager of Twisted project. As you
already know, the other keynote speaker is Russell Keith-Magee, core developer
of Django web framework. Very are excited to have them both aboard!

The rest of speakers will be announced at the beginning of October because
Call for papers is still going on. Have you submitted your talk already?
