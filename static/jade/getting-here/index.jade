    h1 Getting here
    
    p.lead.
      You. Are. Awesome. You want to attend the first PyCon CZ, you've just
      bought your #[a(href=pageUrl("about/tickets.html")) ticket] and now
      you're planning your trip to the lovely village called Brno.

      Have we already told you that Brno is situated in the heart of Europe?
      That's right. Brno is the centroid of the whole continent, the cosmopolis
      of culture, technology, education, and mostly… jokes.
    
    h3 By plane
    
    p.
      If you're travelling by plane, please check out #[a(href="https://skypicker.com") SkyPicker].
      It's a search engine for cheap flights. You need to get as close to Brno
      as possible. Possible airports are:
      
    ul
      li #[strong Prague] (2.5 hours from Brno)
      li #[strong Vienna] (2 hours from Brno)
      li #[strong Bratislava] (2 hours from Brno)
      li #[strong Budapest] (4.5 hours from Brno)
      li and of course #[strong Brno], but it's a very small airport.
    
    h3 By train or bus
    
    p.
      We love trains! The most ecological means of transport. The Czech Republic
      has  a very dense railway network. Buses depart very often to  and from
      most big cities in the Czech Republic. And Brno is a huge city, so you
      will have no problem getting here at all. #[strong Bonus:] Brno is only one stop
      away from Prague when travelling by bus.

    p.
      Use #[a(href="http://jizdnirady.idnes.cz/vlakyautobusy/spojeni/") jizdnirady.cz]
      when looking for a train or bus. If the page loads in Czech, just find
        "English" on the page. It is localized, but uses some kind of
        an obscure mechanism.
    
    h3 By car
    
    p.
      As we mentioned before, Brno is halfway between Prague and Vienna. It
      means that you can use highway #[strong D1] when travelling from Prague (enjoy it,
      it's a real Czech experience). When travelling from Vienna by car, you
      have several #[a(href="https://www.google.cz/maps/dir/Vienna,+Austria/Brno/@48.6934015,16.057494,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x476d079e5136ca9f:0xfdc2e58a51a25b46!2m2!1d16.3738189!2d48.2081743!1m5!1m1!1s0x4712943ac03f5111:0x400af0f6614b1b0!2m2!1d16.6068371!2d49.1950602!3e0") options].
      The shortest path is via Poysdorf and Mikulov, but
      you can also go to Reinthal, Břeclav and then connect to the highway #[strong D2].

      Saturday and Sunday venues are a bit far from each other. The good news
      is that Brno is small. Although it's the biggest city in the Czech Republic
      (Prague isn't a city, but a region), you can travel from one end to another
      in less than one hour. From Saturday venue it's only 20mins to city center
      and Sunday venue is in walking distance from city center.

      We don't have any special deals with local hotels unfortunatelly because
      we didnt't know in advance how many attendees will stay in which hotel.

      The following two hotels are recommended by fellow conference DevConf.

      The hotel is close to the beautiful park and located between both venus.

      aroma sauna, Scottish shower, solar meadow, reflexology zone,
      heated benches and floors).
