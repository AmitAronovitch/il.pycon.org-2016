      "abstract": "This talk is for people interested to see how their programming knowledge can be applied in biology research, particularly genomics.\n\nCurrently, various technologies allow to change genetic information. Among these technologies, CRISPR is the most efficient and safe. \n\nCRISPR contains sequence of 20 letters and it is searching for match in DNA (think of it as a very long string). If it succeeds, then DNA is damaged by the cut.\nThis ability can be used  for targeted genome editing, where regions of interest can be changed.\n\nIn order to change DNA at the right place, scientists need to design the sequence which would match the target DNA.\n\nThe designed sequence shouldn't match anywhere else in the genome. Since this is biology, things are not perfect. The sequences may match even if there are a few mismatched letters. When we identify the candidate sequences, the most computationally intensive part is to look for places in the whole genome where the candidate could at least partially match.\n\nOur tool for designing such sequences is written in Python, using Django and Berkeley DB. For one analysis, we run tens of millions queries against a database of 700 million sites in genome.",

This device will be used to navigate through the presentation. The Leap Motion Controller tracks both hands in front of the screen. From a web developer’s perspective, both devices allows us to use gestures, previously restricted to touch devices, on desktops. EyeTribe is an affordable eye-tracking device.\n\nThe talk will briefly cover setting up SDKs and python wrappers, and then focus on possible uses in daily life, business and, of course, web app development. Code examples will be included. In addition, the trade-offs between processing this new type of input data in the client versus processing input on the server will be discussed.",
