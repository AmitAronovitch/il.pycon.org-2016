    "abstract": "Have you ever wanted to secure your python application with some cryptography, but got confused by APIs which were too low level? [Python-cryptography](https://cryptography.io) is a new emerging library which strives to provide \"crypto for humans\" in Python. In this workshop, we will explore how to use it to secure our applications in a reliable manner. No substantial cryptography knowledge required.",

This workshop will give you overview of some basic libraries and their Python bindings ([GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/), [Proj4](https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/wiki)), more abstract and easier to be used libraries ([Rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio), [Fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona/manual.html), [Shapely](http://toblerity.org/shapely/manual.html)), and show you how to access GeoServer and Mapserver from Python scripts. OGC Standards and how to deal with them will be demonstrated using [OWSLib](http://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/).\n\nOf course, the topic is so wide, that at the end nobody is expected to master the mentioned (or not mentioned) technologies. This workshop is meant as an introduction to the world of GeoPython, and a brief overview.",

    "title": "Event-Sourced Domain Models in Python",
    "abstract": "In first part of this workshop we explore how to implement rich domain models using plain-old Python objects which are completely independent of any particular persistence technology such as an object-relational mapper. Domain models often embody the core value of software systems, so implementing models independently of - often ephemeral - technology choices is an important strategy for long-lived, high-value systems.\n\nIn the second part of this workshop we implement an event-sourced architecture for persistence of our domain model, whereby all changes applied to the model are recorded as events in a simple, append-only event-store. From this event store we can reconstitute the model state as it was at any historical time, something that is difficult – if not impossible – to do with most object-relational solutions. Furthermore, we can project the event stream into other representations to support queries which are not conveniently supported by the entities in our model, or which roll-up historical data. Among many other benefits, such projected read-models gives very high scalability on the read-side\n\nThis workshop is aimed at Python developers who want to step beyond the limits of canned framework-based solutions such as Django models, or toolkits such as SQLAlchemy, (which are ultimately about managing the horrors of shared-mutable state). Event-sourced domain models facilitate allow us to combine the best aspects of object-oriented design with robust and simple persistence inspired by functional-programming practice.",

Don't worry, it is very easy when we can use the [novaclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient) module.

We will present all these things in a simple example, where we will  create our own “remote controller of  OpenStack”.",
